The team is conducting simulations to model the interactions between detectors and particles using Geant4, an object-oriented Monte Carlo simulation toolkit. Developed by a global collaboration of scientists, Geant4 accurately simulates how particles traverse through different materials. This software provides our team with a powerful and efficient tool to design and optimize our experiments. The team is particularly interested in studying the effects of varying absorbing materials and their thicknesses on particle interactions within our scintillation materials. The team has used Geant4 to conduct testing on several different Polyvinyltoluene bases supplied by Eljen Technologies, a reputable manufacturer of scintillation materials with whom previous students have collaborated on prior projects. Here are some figures that showcase the outcomes of simulations conducted using 1 MeV and 2 MeV electrons on different materials, including one layer of 0.1 centimeters and a second layer of 0.2 centimeters. These simulation results are playing a vital role in advancing the fabrication of the SEE detector and assisting us in selecting the most suitable scintillation material for our specific application:
