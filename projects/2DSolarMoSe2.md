Molebdynum Diselenide, a Transition-Metal Dichalcogenide (TMDC) is a byproduct in the production of layered deposition of thin film solar panels. Because of this, we are interested in the bandgap of monolayer and multilatyer MoSe2 as well as its other properties with regards to solar panel materials. In this project, we will discuss how we calculated these material properties by using the ab initio plane wave code Quantum Espresso, and as well as some of the results we gathered.
