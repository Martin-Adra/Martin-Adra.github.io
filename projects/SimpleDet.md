This study compares the remnants of mergers between radially-anisotropic spherical galaxies with their isotropic look-alikes. Utilizing N-body simulations with varying degrees of initial anisotropy, we analyze the resulting relaxed remnants to assess differences in their shapes and density profiles. Our analysis focuses on how the faster merger rates observed in anisotropic models influence the transfer of angular momentum during the collision process. By comparing these dynamics, this research aims to display the impact of anisotropy on the equilibrium states of the remnant structures of these merged galaxies.
