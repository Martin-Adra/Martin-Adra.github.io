In my time as a researcher, I have made many mistakes in my codes. It could be something huge that a certain function should not be running a certain calculation, or something so small such as a variable type change. Going into TypeScript has amazed me with how beautiful, but simple their logic is in the language. Assigning types in this fashion made me feel reassured about what is chaning and what is constant. Mainly, the flexibility it has with JavaScript and its structure brings me joy as a programmer since other languages would have a hard time doing things TypeScript would be doing. 

## Organization is Key!

For one of my jobs I had to interview with, they asked me how I organized my code. As any average programmer would say, I would put sections and made sure my code is readable through the comments I put. Of course, there is much more to this as any good programmer should follow clean and responsible guidelines in how to format their code. However, as I said earlier, the languages I worked with would not provide "best practices" as good as TypeScript would in terms of being organized. For example, with TypeScript, it is very easy and effective to call out a variable whether it needs to be constant or changed.
