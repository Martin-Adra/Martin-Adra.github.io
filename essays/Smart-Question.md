In my eyes, smart questions are characterized by clarity, specificity, and completeness. For software engineers, mastering the art of asking such questions makes troubleshooting much better. Conversely, poorly framed questions can lead to misunderstandings, insufficient assistance, and a waste of valuable time for both the asker and potential responders. Despite this negative effect, poor questions still come up from time to time. 

Speaking of questions, one prime website that us software engineers always venture to for answers is Stack Overflow. Whenever a question pops up in their mind that is not answerable at that moment, Stack Overflow is always the place to go to. So, let's talk about this amazing source and explore this idea of smart questions!

## Not so smart, but we must ask

When going into Stack Overflow, it would typically require you to ask a smart question. However, let's look into one that is not from this source



```
function projectEulerOne(num : number){
    let sum = 0
    for (let x = 10 ; x % 3 || x % 5 == 0 ; x--){
        sum += x
    } 

    return sum;

}
console.log(projectEulerOne(1000))
```

Notice the way the parameter is written and the variable "sum" has that "let" written. With this organization, I can clearly see the types of variables they are, whether they will be changed or if they are just some kind of string or number. Doing this over and over again and reading other people's codes with this good practice, it is just great in my opinion!
